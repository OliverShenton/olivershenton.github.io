        <p>
          I am a highly motivated Web Developer with a robust foundation in both front-end and

          <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>. I am particularly passionate
          about creating intuitive and responsive web applications that deliver seamless user
          experiences. My proficiency in modern frameworks such as React enables me to design
          scalable and dynamic interfaces, while my back-end skills allow me to build efficient and
          secure server-side architectures.

          consistently strive for excellence in my work and am driven by a problem-solving mindset.
          My experience with end-to-end project development has given me a comprehensive
          understanding of the development lifecycle, from ideation and design to deployment and
          maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I bring an analytical and detail-oriented approach, honed through my{" "}
          <strong>experience as a DNA Analyst</strong> working in high-pressure environments. This
          role equipped me with strong organisational, communication, and problem-solving skills,
          which I seamlessly integrate into my development work. I am committed to leveraging both
          my technical and analytical skillsets to contribute to impactful projects and drive
          innovation.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
